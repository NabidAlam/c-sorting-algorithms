# c-sorting-algorithms

A collection of sorting algorithms written in C.

## Why sorting algorithms?

Sorting is a common task in software development. Most languages have a sort method implemented in standard libraries, so why learn sorting algorithms?
 
Learning sorting algorithms teaches you algorithm design. You will learn how to use paradigms like [divide and conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm), how to measure algorithm efficiency and when to use different sorting algorithms to maximize efficiency.

## Arguments

### arr

Array to be sorted. It is [passed by reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1106977/4939630).

### n

Number of elements in `arr`.
